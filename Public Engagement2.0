                                Since none of our team members had any experience in such a big event as the giant jamboree we wanted to recreate this atmosphere in Leuven. A presentation in front of hundreds of people, all with scientific background, can be pretty scary. So to prepare our team and the other teams in the best way possible, we planned to bring as much teams as possible together in Leuven for the European Practice Jamboree. The goal of this meet-up was to practice the presentations so the team members who are presenting in Boston get used to a stage and a crowd in front of them. Of course we could never reach the same amount of attendees as the Giant Jamboree in Boston but we could try to get together as many people as possible. <br><br>

                                We planned this meet-up from the beginning of our journey, because we were very enthusiastic to meet our fellow iGEM teams. First we went to the Benelux Meet-up at Wageningen University, there we had a great time and get to know the Dutch teams. It was really nice to interact with so many young and enthusiastic people, all enrolled in the iGEM competition. The atmosphere there couldn’t be described. This meet-up took place in the beginning of the summer, so the only thing we could present was our project ideas since we weren’t able to start until the summer holidays. <br><br>

                                We wanted to go a step further and waited till the 7th of October to make sure the teams finished or nearly finished their project. In that way they could present everything they had done during the summer, which would represent their presentation in Boston. We invited every team from Europe to our European Practice Jamboree, eventually 4 teams responded and attended this event. Representatives of iGEM team Amsterdam, Ionis Paris, Aachen and Munich attended the event. They had prepared a presentation and a poster, every team had the chance to present their project and get feedback from the crowd. In this way the teams are able to adjust their presentation based on the critics and feedback from the other iGEM teams. In between the presentations we could enjoy the talks of 2 professors of the KU Leuven (professor Jos Vander Sloten and professor Johan Swinnen). The last one inspired us all with his life story as researcher, this summer he ran 2400 kilometers from Leuven to Santiago de Compostela. All of this as a tribute to cancer patients all over the world. His story inspired the iGEM teams to go further and push through their limits in this project. Afterwards we could enjoy a tasteful dinner which everyone attended, all the team members mixed and sat together. Everyone had a great time and got to know their fellow iGEM students a bit better, we all share a common goal and that made it a little easier to break the ice. After dinner the teams presented their poster, everyone could freely move and ask questions where necessary. In this way they are able to change some of the details so it would be perfect for Boston. We finished with a great group picture and a gift for everyone, our heart shaped stress balls as a memorabilia to our event.<br><br>

                                We would like to thank all the people who were present: Bram, Thijs and Josine from iGEM Amsterdam. Dawa and Robert form iGEM Munich. Svenja, Johanna, Sergio, Michael and Thori from iGEM Aachen. Paul, Nicolas, Gabrielle, Agathe, Antoine, Alicia and Eliott from iGEM Ionis Paris. We had an amazing day with you and can’t wait to meet you in Boston.</p>

                                Aside from direct contact with kids, adults, patients, and experts, we wanted to reach a bigger number of people at once. ‘Eos’ is a well-known scientific magazine designed to bring scientific news and developments to a Dutch-speaking audience with both scientific and non-scientific backgrounds. Naturally, we considered Eos an ideal environment to publish something about our iGEM project, given its broad target group. 
                                <br>
                                <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/1/10/EOS_blog.PNG" width="40%" style="float: right; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px;"></img>
                                <br>
                                We started by kindly asking Eos to write an article about us. As we expected, they kindly reclined. However, they surprisingly offered us a writer’s account on their website, and the opportunity to write one or more articles our self. Without hesitation, we accepted this opportunity thankfully, and started writing. <br><br>
                                In total, we wrote four articles about iGEM. In the first one, we described how we got started with iGEM, and how we came up with our HEKcite project. Secondly, we wrote about the ‘dark’ side of science. The part of research where everything goes wrong, and how to deal with that. In our third article, we gave a more loose description of our activities outside the lab (sponsoring, meetings, education projects…). In our fourth and final article, we published a quick overview of our scientific results, and future directions.<br><br><br>
                                According to the staff of Eos, every article reached around 1200 readers one week after publication. Therefore, we can conclude that we successfully brought synthetic biology, iGEM, and HEKcite, to a broad public. And that couldn’t make us more proud.
